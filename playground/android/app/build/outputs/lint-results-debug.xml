        summary="Obsolete Gradle Dependency"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

    <issue
        id="SpUsage"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Should use &quot;`sp`&quot; instead of &quot;`dp`&quot; for text sizes"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="3"
        summary="Using `dp` instead of `sp` for text sizes"
        explanation="When setting text sizes, you should normally use `sp`, or &quot;scale-independent pixels&quot;. This is like the `dp` unit, but it is also scaled by the user&apos;s font size preference. It is recommend you use this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for both the screen density and the user&apos;s preference.

There *are* cases where you might need to use `dp`; typically this happens when the text is in a container with a specific dp-size. This will prevent the text from spilling outside the container. Note however that this means that the user&apos;s font size settings are not respected, so consider adjusting the layout itself to be more flexible."

        severity="Warning"
        message="[I18N] Hardcoded string &quot;Writing your test project&quot;, should use `@string` resource"
        category="Internationalization"
        priority="5"
        summary="Hardcoded text"
        explanation="Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several reasons:

* When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or portrait)you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when making changes)

* The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding new translations for existing string resources.

There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a resource lookup."
